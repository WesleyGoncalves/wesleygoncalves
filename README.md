### Hi, I'm Wesley ðŸ‘‹

Collaborative, proactive software developer committed to delivering results and eager to learn.

Over the years, I have developed web, desktop, and mobile applications using several popular languages, such as **C, PHP, Python, Java, and JavaScript**, and worked with major frameworks like **Laravel, Flask, Angular, and Bootstrap**. I have also used tools like **Git CLI**, **Jira**, and agile methodologies like **Scrum**. I have also become familiar with some **Linux Ubuntu** commands.

For more details on my work and experience, please check my [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/wesley-d-goncalves) and [GitHub](https://github.com/WesleyGoncalves) profiles.
